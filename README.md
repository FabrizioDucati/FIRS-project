This ontology was developed for the workshop on ontology modelling held on 18 December 2025 at the University of Bologna (Italy). It provides a structured conceptualisation of ceramic finds from archaeological excavations, with particular emphasis on the origin of the artefacts.

The model is designed as a heavyweight ontology containing T-Box information, defining classes, properties, and logical constraints relevant to the study and interpretation of ceramic artefacts.

# Objectives

- To present a conceptual framework for the description and analysis of archaeological ceramic artefacts.
- To demonstrate ontology modelling principles during the workshop.
- To offer a reusable T-Box foundation for further development, extension, or integration with CIDOC CRM–based models.

## Scope

This ontology includes:

- Classes representing concepts of archaeologica calssification (CeramicClasses, CeramicType, CeramicShape, ArtefactIdentifier) and artefact location (ProductionPlace, DiscoveryPalce).
- Relationships describing manufacturing techniques, provenance, and archaeological context.
- Logical axioms intended to support reasoning over arcaheological datasets.

It is suitable for educational, experimental, and research applications within archaeology and cultural heritage informatics.

## Files Included

- `ontology.owl` — main ontology file in OWL format
- `documentation/` — supporting material used during the workshop

## How to Use

1. Open the ontology in **Protégé** (recommended version ≥ 5.5).
2. Explore the class hierarchy to understand the conceptual structure.
3. Extend the ontology with A-Box instances by importing tabular data using the Cellfie plug-in.
